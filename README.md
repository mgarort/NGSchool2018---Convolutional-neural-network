### DESCRIPTION ###

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with an example of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies rare breast tumors (lobular carcinoma and papillary carcinoma) based on histology pictures from the BreaKHis_v1 dataset (https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/breast-cancer-histopathological-database-breakhis/).

### PURPOSE ###

I've created this simple piece of code to support my application for NGSchool2018. It is a replacement for the code of my current project at the Centre for Genomic Regulation, on cancer classification from genomic data, since I cannot release it until the paper gets published.
